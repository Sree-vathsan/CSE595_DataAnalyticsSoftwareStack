CSE 595 - Course Project - Health Care Data Analytics

Group No: 3
Dataset: 5

###Problem Statement
1)     Given sets of areas enclosed by polygons Si and Sj , generate area defined by intersection.  

2)     Generate set Sk of polygons that constitute this intersection

3)     For a user specified spatial region,  display Si,  Sj and Sk

4)     For a user specified spatial region, calculate the correspondence between sets of polygons Si and Sj .  There are a variety of ways of doing this â€“ e.g.   2*area of Sk/(area of Si + area of Sj)

5)     Compute feature vectors Fi from Pathology images.  Be creative about choice of features.  Examples:  a) Mask area, perimeter,  shape, b) Within-mask texture,  c) Padded region texture

6)     Compute differences between each feature vector and for collections of feature vectors for overlapping nuclei

7)     Use color/shading to depict variation between different spatial regions of 1) nuclear  spatial overlap  2) various measures of  feature vector difference
